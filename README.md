# A Rat Cortex Video Segmentation Dataset for Intrinsic Optical Signal Tracking and Neural Activity Analysis
From MixLab, SIAT, ShenZhen, China.

# Abstract
Intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI) enables non-invasive monitoring of neural activity in the rat cortex, yet quantitative analysis remains hindered by low signal intensity, complex spatiotemporal patterns, and the lack of standardized benchmarks. To tackle this challenge, we present RatCortex-IOS â€“ a novel open-access video segmentation dataset specifically designed for standardizing IOS analysis in awake rodent models. Meanwhile, we implement an efficient processing pipeline leveraging foundation models to ensure annotation consistency while minimizing manual intervention. The dataset supports quantitative characterization of neural activation parameters including signal propagation velocity and cortical response topography, serving as a critical benchmark for developing automated analysis tools. Furthermore, this resource facilitates technique development in neuroimaging studies and accelerates the integration of computational approaches in IOS-based neuroscience research.
